There are pros and cons on every solution:

using email: www.kokosint2580@emal.com/

Users have to type their possibly longer-than-username mail address for login your mail address is disclosed to by-standers You can never log in again when you change your mailbox or loos access to it Changing the mail adress is not possible or requires much application intelligence (but see the same for username changing in the username section below) You don't have to remember a username You can allow users to choose a display (user) name and change it whenever they want using a username:kokosint

Users don't have to guess which of their mail adress they use, assuming many users have several mail accounts Users have to remember a username Users may change their username when the software designer internally uses a GUID or the like as primary key, not the entered username Login is faster (www.kokosint2580@email.com)
